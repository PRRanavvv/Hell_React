- Default Export/Import 

export default Component;  (only once per module)
import Component from "path";  (can be named anything)


- Named Export/Import 

export const Component;   (multiple per module)
import {Component} from "path";   (must use exact exported names) ..... like {useEffect} and {useState}

# React Hooks
(Normal JS utility functions)


- useState() ~ basically used to generate and manage superpowerful state variables within a functional component.... replaces the class-based component state management.


- useEffect() ~ this allows you to perform side effects (data fetching)..... it runs after the component's already rendered and can be used to handle lifecycle events.

# Unique Key id while using map:


Each item in the list must be uniquely identified

Why?
When we have components at same level and if a new component
comes on the first without ID, DOM is going to re-render all the
components again. As DOM canâ€™t identify where to place it. 

But if we give each of them a unique ID then react knows where
to put that component according to the ID. It is a good
optimization and performance thing. 

~ Note Never use index as keys in map. It is not recommended.
